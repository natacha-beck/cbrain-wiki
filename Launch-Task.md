* Select the files needed for the task you are going to run. Please remember you can search files by name, use the filters available to select the files,  for example by File type,  or create a custom filter.

Then you will have to set the **project** to run the job. You can add a brief description of the job, as notes particular to the task you are running for future reference.
   *  **Preset Management** - By default this section is hidden, and allows you to have preset configurations stored and recalled for future reference. 
   *  **Task Parameters** - Finally, this is the section of the page that will allow you to set the input parameters for your task.  This section will change depending on the tool that you run.
