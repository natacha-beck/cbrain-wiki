You have 4 different ways to upload files (depending on the number/size you need for your project) that will be stored on one of CBRAIN's data providers.

**Data Providers - Network Storage Space**: The files in CBRAIN are stored in a "Data Provider", which is a network storage space for files on a computer. This could be on your own computer or on another computer you connect to using CBRAIN.
