3. Configuration of your private data provider

* **HOSTNAME**: this is the serverâ€™s name where you are getting the file from. 
In this example, I want to move a file from Compute Canada Beluga to the private data provider hosted in CBRAIN
* **USERNAME** of your Compute Canada Account
* **PATH**: where the file is located in Beluga

4. SSH KEY SET UP

Before saving your configuration, you will need to configure the SSH in your host storage.
A public SSH key needs to be added to the authorized keys of the user on the host. Paste the SSH key bellow in a text file 

* If you use the nano or pico text editor, please make sure to use the
`-w`
option to prevent the editor from splitting the line of the key. The SSH key must all be in a single long line

* Run a command to add it to the authorized keys file on the host, as for an example the below one:
`ssh-copy-id -f -i key.pub username@hostname`

If you prefer, you can also directly create a `.ssh` directory on your host server, add the `authorized key` file in `.ssh` and copy the SSH key in that file without using the previous command line.
