By creating your own project, you can upload and analyze data, as well as invite other members to collaborate with you. 
A project can either be publicly available or private. 

To create your personal project, please simply follow the steps below: 

* Log in to [CBRAIN](https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca/):
You are sent to the project summary page.  A project is a storage space unit for your files and tasks.  You can either open an existing project by clicking on it or create a new one.
* Click on "Create Project"

  * Projects are colour coded according to whether each project is Personal (blue), Shared (green), Site (purple), Public (brown) or  All (white).
  * In this case, the "Example" we created is Personal (blue).
