# Sign up for a CBRAIN account

If you haven't already done so, you can sign up for a CBRAIN account free on the McGill CBRAIN portal.  Just go to https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca and click on the link for "Request an Account".  Please fill out the form and once completed, you will receive a confirmation email, just to verify that it is real. Please be patient as we will need to have the account approved, so it may take a little time to process (usually within a few hours).

If you already have a CBRAIN account or once you have your account approved, please login to the CBRAIN portal. 

Once you log into CBRAIN you should see be taken directly to the **Projects** page, which will list all of the current projects to which you belong.  It should look something like below:
