Oxford_asl is a tool to estimate Cerebral Blood Flow in the brain using Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). 
In ASL imaging, the purpose is to label blood by a magnetic field (in MRI scanner). 
We take an image then we take another image without labelling blood. 
We subtract these two images and we can then quantify Cerebral blood flow (perfusion) in the brain using quantification methods. 
Oxford_asl does this quantification.
