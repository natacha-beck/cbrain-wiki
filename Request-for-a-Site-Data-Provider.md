For users or groups that plan to shuffle really large amounts of data into CBRAIN, the previous two options might still be too cumbersome. 
A third option is available by contacting the CBRAIN admins @ support@neurohub.ca to install your own **Site Data Provider**. 
The process is simple and only requires a standard LINUX or Mac OS X computer at your site. It can also be done entirely using a standard UNIX user account, root access is not necessary. 

The advantages of having your own Data Provider:
* Files can be simply placed in a local directory and registered in CBRAIN without having to copy them anywhere else
* CBRAIN tasks will fetch the files directly from your computer, and send back the results of running tasks directly there too
* Data can be shared with other users/groups.

If you are interested please send a request to support@neurohub.ca and we will be happy to set it up for you!
