In this section, we can find all the required information to [Get a NeuroHub account](https://github.com/neurohub/neurohub_documentation/wiki/1.1.Get-a-NeuroHub-account) which will quickly unlock all the potential of [CBRAIN](https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca/login).

As a [NeuroHub](https://neurohub.ca/) user, you have access to diverse multimodal and multidisciplinary large-scale research data. You will be able to create your own projects, invite collaborators, collect data, run, store and share analyses in [CBRAIN](https://cbrain.ca/).

The typical workflow in CBRAIN will be the following:

* [[Create a project]]
* Select files (from the [[Available Datasets]] or [[Upload files]]) 
* [[Launch task]] 
* Analyses the [[Task results]] 
* [[Download files]] or view directly the output on the browser
